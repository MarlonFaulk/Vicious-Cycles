		<p>This company prides it self on selling, and customizing the best bikes. We do everything from basic causal bicycles to pro BMX bikes that actual professionals use in tournaments. We sell only the top brands that are reliable. We only use the top tier premium bike parts for our custom bike builds. We would never use anything that isn't the best for our clients.

All of our employee's are knowledgeable bike expert who can tall you everything you would want to know about your bike or maybe a future purchase of one. The employees can even help put the bike together if you rather not do it yourself. If you pride yourself on it and would like to build your own bike by yourself don't worry we sell all the parts you would ever need to put it together. If you would also like a tutorial on how to do it our fine employees can help you step by step put it together. We can also make and ship the bike to you if you would prefer to not come into the store.We use extra padding in all of our shipments of bikes. Our stores will also be putting on bike enthusiast events to help build the biking community in our area. Every Friday and Saturday we will put on a bike marathon that anyone young or old can join. We will all meet outside of the store and bike around the block 15 times. Hopefully on the way we can pick up some extra people who didn't know about the store event. So get your parent and kids ready because we are gonna be biking all day. The event will also be raising money for charity if you would want to donate to the cause.</p>
